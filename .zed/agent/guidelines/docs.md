# DOCS Writing Guidelines

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Follow these guidelines strictly

1. Focus on user needs. Answer user questions and help them accomplish tasks.
2. Structure for readability. Use headings, lists, and code examples to break up
   dense text. Organize content logically with clear section hierarchies.
3. Keep documentation up to date. Documentation must reflect the current state
   of the codebase. When you change functionality, update the corresponding
   documentation immediately.
4. Review for clarity. After writing documentation, read it from the perspective
   of a new user. Ask yourself: Is the purpose clear? Can a user accomplish
   their task following this documentation?
5. Be practical over promotional. Focus on what users can do, not on marketing
   language like "powerful," "revolutionary," or "best-in-class."
6. Be honest about limitations. When a feature is missing or limited, say so
   directly and provide workarounds or alternative workflows.
7. Be direct and concise. Use short sentences. Get to the point. Developers are
   scanning, not reading novels.
8. Use second person. Address the reader as "you." Avoid "the user" or "one."
9. Use present tense. "The application opens the file" not "The application will
   open the file."
10. Avoid superlatives without substance ("incredibly fast," "seamlessly
    integrated").
11. Avoid hedging language ("simply," "just," "easily")—if something is simple,
    the instructions will show it.
12. Avoid apologetic tone for missing features—state the limitation and move on.
13. Avoid comparisons that disparage other tools—be factual, not competitive.
14. Avoid meta-commentary about honesty ("the honest take is...", "to be
    frank...", "honestly...").
15. Avoid filler words ("entirely," "certainly," "deeply," "definitely,"
    "actually")—these add nothing.
16. Use simple, direct English. Avoid complex words and academic phrasing.
    Examples: "multiple concerns simultaneously" -> "several concerns",
    "unnecessary coupling" -> "extra dependencies", "convoluted" -> "complex",
    "facilitate" -> "help" or "enable", "in order to" -> "to".
17. Use active voice. "Add feature" not "Feature was added."
18. Keep sentences short and to the point.
