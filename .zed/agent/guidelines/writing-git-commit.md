# Git Commit Writing Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Follow these strict writing guidelines for all git commit
messages.

1. Subject line MUST be 50 characters or less.
2. Use active voice. "Add feature" not "Feature was added."
3. Use present tense. "The application opens the file" not "The application will
   open the file."
4. Be concise and technical. Focus on what changed and why.
5. Keep sentences short and to the point.
6. Be practical over promotional. Focus on what users can do, not on marketing
   language like "powerful," "revolutionary," or "best-in-class."
7. Be honest about limitations. When a feature is missing or limited, say so
   directly.
8. Use simple, direct English. Avoid complex words and academic phrasing.
   Examples: "multiple concerns simultaneously" -> "several concerns",
   "unnecessary coupling" -> "extra dependencies", "convoluted" -> "complex",
   "facilitate" -> "help" or "enable", "in order to" -> "to".
9. Avoid filler words ("entirely," "certainly," "deeply," "definitely,"
   "actually")—these add nothing.
10. Avoid hedging language ("simply," "just," "easily")—if something is simple,
    the commit description will show it.
11. Avoid superlatives without substance ("incredibly fast," "seamlessly
    integrated").
12. Avoid apologetic tone for missing features—state the limitation and move on.
13. Avoid comparisons that disparage other tools—be factual, not competitive.
14. Avoid meta-commentary about honesty ("the honest take is...", "to be
    frank...", "honestly...").
